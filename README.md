## Customer-Churn-Dynamics: Key Insights And Metrics
The goal of the "Customer Churn Dynamics " project was to understand and address customer churn using a dataset from Kaggle. I started by cleaning and arranging the data to ensure accuracy. Then, I analyzed the data to pinpoint the main factors driving customer churn. Based on these findings, I developed actionable insights to help the business lower churn rates and enhance customer retention strategies. Additionally, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to present these insights clearly, making it easier for stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the data.

Tools I Used:
Excel - Used for organizing and cleaning the dataset.
SQL - Performed data querying, manipulation, and optimized retrieval for insightful analysis.
Power Bi - Created an interactive dashboard to visually present insights on customer churn, facilitating informed decision-making.
